1) Create three variables in a single line and assign different values to them and
make sure their data types are invited differently. Like one is int, another one is float
and last one is string.

a, b, c= 1, 2.5, 'Charmi'

2) Create a variable of value type complex and swap it with another variable
whose value is an integer.

x = 3
y = 2j
x, y = y, x
print("x =",x)
check type by print(type(x)) ---- This should now return class complex instead of int

3) Swap two numbers using third variable as result name and do the same task
without using any third variable.
#Using 3rd Variable
x = 5
y = 10
Result = x 
x = y
y = Result
print ('New Value of x: {}'.format(x))
print ('New Value of y: {}'.format(y))

#without using 3rd variable
x = 4
y = 40
x, y = y, x
print("x =",x)
print("y =",y)

7. Create Variable using CamelCase, LadderCase and UPPERCASE.
enterYourName = Charmi ---- CamelCase
ENTERYOURNAME = Charmi ---- UPPERCASE
enterYourName = Charmi ----- LadderCase

8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type
value is assigned to ‘a’ again. Will it change the value. If Yes then Why?

Yes same variable can be assigned to a different data type. Variable is an empty box and that can be reassigned any data type you wish to. Old value will be replaced with new value.
